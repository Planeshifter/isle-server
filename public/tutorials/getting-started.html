<p>Welcome to ISLE! This page describes how to set up an account and get started with ISLE.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-isle-account">Creating an ISLE Account</h2>
<p>If you do not have an ISLE account, the first step is to create one so that you can join a course and complete lessons. To create an account, go to <a href="https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/dashboard/" class="uri">https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/dashboard/</a> and click <strong>Sign up</strong>. Then enter your name, email address, and desired password, and click <strong>Sign up</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that your course may require you to use your official university email (rather than a personal email address) when creating the account. If you are unsure, ask your instructor to check what they require.</p>
<h2 id="logging-in">Logging In</h2>
<p>Once you have an account, you can log in at <a href="https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/dashboard/" class="uri">https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/dashboard/</a>. Logging in will take you to your ISLE dashboard; the first time you log in, your dashboard will be empty except for your user profile and will look something like this:</p>

<p>If you are already part of a course, you might not see your profile when you log in. To view your profile, click your name in the top right, next to the Log Out button.</p>
<h2 id="enrolling-in-a-course">Enrolling in a Course</h2>
<p>Now that you have an ISLE account, you can enroll in a course!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click the <strong>Open Your Courses</strong> button in the bar at the top of the dashboard.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Enroll</strong> in the dropdown menu that appears.</li>
<li>The available courses to enroll in will appear. Which courses are available depends on you institutional affiliation, as specified by the email account you used to create your ISLE account.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Enroll</strong> for your desired course, then select the cohort you belong to. Cohorts are generally used when there are multiple sections of a course, or multiple lab sections. If you are unsure which cohort to choose, check with your instructor. If there is only one cohort, choose that cohort.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Enroll to this Course</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you’ve enrolled in a course, so you’re ready to get started with lessons. To navigate to your course, click the <strong>Open Your Courses</strong> button in the bar at the top of the dashboard (or the button with 4 horizontal lines), then select the course from the dropdown menu that appears. All available lessons for that course will appear. To open a lesson, hover over the lesson and click <strong>Open Lesson</strong>.</p>
