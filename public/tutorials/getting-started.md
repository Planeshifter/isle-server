Welcome to ISLE! This page describes how to set up an account and get started with ISLE.

## Creating an ISLE Account

If you do not have an ISLE account, the first step is to create one so that you can join a course and complete lessons. To create an account, go to <https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/dashboard/> and click **Sign up**. Then enter your name, email address, and desired password, and click **Sign up**.

Note that your course may require you to use your official university email (rather than a personal email address) when creating the account. If you are unsure, ask your instructor to check what they require.

## Logging In

Once you have an account, you can log in at <https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/dashboard/>. Logging in will take you to your ISLE dashboard; the first time you log in, your dashboard will be empty except for your user profile and will look something like this:

If you are already part of a course, you might not see your profile when you log in. To view your profile, click your name in the top right, next to the Log Out button.

## Enrolling in a Course

Now that you have an ISLE account, you can enroll in a course!

1. Click the **Open Your Courses** button in the bar at the top of the dashboard.
2. Click **Enroll** in the dropdown menu that appears.
3. The available courses to enroll in will appear. Which courses are available depends on you institutional affiliation, as specified by the email account you used to create your ISLE account.
4. Click **Enroll** for your desired course, then select the cohort you belong to. Cohorts are generally used when there are multiple sections of a course, or multiple lab sections. If you are unsure which cohort to choose, check with your instructor. If there is only one cohort, choose that cohort.
5. Click **Enroll to this Course**.

## Opening a Lesson

At this point, you've enrolled in a course, so you're ready to get started with lessons. To navigate to your course, click the **Open Your Courses** button in the bar at the top of the dashboard (or the button with 4 horizontal lines), then select the course from the dropdown menu that appears. All available lessons for that course will appear. To open a lesson, hover over the lesson and click **Open Lesson**.
